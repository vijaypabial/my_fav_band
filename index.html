    AC/DC are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1973 by Scottish-born
    brothers Malcolm and Angus Young.[1] Their music has been variously
    described as hard rock, blues rock, and heavy metal;[2] however, the band
    themselves describe their music as simply "rock and roll".[3] AC/DC
    underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High
    Voltage, in 1975. Membership subsequently stabilised around the Young
    brothers, singer Bon Scott, drummer Phil Rudd, and bass player Mark Evans.
    Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage. In
    February 1980, a few months after recording the album Highway to Hell, lead
    singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died of acute alcohol poisoning.[4] The
    group considered disbanding but stayed together, bringing in Brian Johnson
    as replacement for Scott.[5] Later that year, the band released their first
    album with Johnson, Back in Black, which they dedicated to Scott's memory.
    The album launched them to new heights of success and became one of the best
    selling albums of all time.
